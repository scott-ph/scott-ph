   <h1>Kicking the tires on bhyve UEFI HTTP Boot</h1>
   <p>The -devel port for bhyve's uefi firmware has just
      been <a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports?view=revision&revision=499851">committed</a>. Here's
      a sketch of how you can kick the tires and give it a try:</p>

   <p>HTTP boot can boot either a UEFI binary (like loader.efi) or a
      disk image, which it will set up as a ramdisk and boot in the
      normal UEFI way. One easy way to try out HTTP boot is to set it
      up to boot the installer image straight from the URL:</p>

   <p><pre>http://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/amd64/ISO-IMAGES/12.0/FreeBSD-12.0-RELEASE-amd64-bootonly.iso</pre></p>

   <p>The easiest way to arrange for that is to type `exit` at the EFI
      shell to be taken to the configuration UI, and then go through
      the menus to:</p>

   <p>Device Manager >> Network Device List >> MAC:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
      >> HTTP Boot Configuration >> Boot URI</p>

   <p>and paste in the URL. This creates a new boot option for HTTP
      with the given URL. Then go back to the top of the configuration
      menus and go to:</p>

   <p>Boot Maintenance Manager >> Boot Options >> Change Boot
      Order</p>

   <p>make the newly created HTTP boot option the first one and commit
      that change.</p>

   <p>When you get to the FreeBSD loader, escape to the loader prompt
      and do:</p>

   <pre>
  load /boot/kernel/kernel
  load /boot/kernel/nvdimm.ko
  boot
   </pre>

   <p>The nvdimm kernel module is needed to recognize the ram disk
      that UEFI has created. You should then boot to a working
      system. bsdinstall failed for me when I tried to do an install,
      I think because it wants to use a place on the cd9660
      filesystem as its DISTDIR.</p>
